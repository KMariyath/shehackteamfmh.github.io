			        <p style="font-size:20px;">Knowing how to code has numerous benefits when it comes to efficiently programming a computer. Computer programmers can produce a program or app that could help us to solve everyday problems or allow us to learn something new. In this developing world programmers have the finest carrier opportunity. however, In this era there are many challenges for us to make our future bright. But also there are opportunities,  and most of them are expensive and difficult for us as the beginners. So by the help of TinkerHub community, we were able to participate and experience the world in the eyes of the programmers. Therefore we are expecting to be the part of the program SheHack.</p>

			        <p style="font-size:18px;">By applying for this program  my vision is to develop my coding skills. Knowing how to code has numerous benefits when it comes to efficiently programming a computer. Computer programmers can produce a program or an app that could help us solve an everyday problem, or allow us to learn something new. However, when we look beyond the computer, learning to code has further advantages.
  I hadn't done any projects in prior of this, but always like to do it to make future bright. However there where no chances for that. SheHacks is a great opportunity for me to learn and do it with the help of mentors. </p>
